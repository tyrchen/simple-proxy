VAN: please initialize memory bank based on the @_code.md

Enter PLAN mode: the next biggest thing for this project is to use extism to support a plugin based system to make it pretty flexible to extend the tool. The core system should allow plugin to do the following things:
- modify request header
- modify request header and body
- modify response header
- modify response header and body
- based on the request info, directly generated response header and body for the core to response

Enter IMPLEMENT mode, please first define proper data structure to integrate extism sdk
